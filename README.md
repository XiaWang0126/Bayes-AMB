# Analytics Methods for Business

# Module Description

This module provides a collection of standard analytical methods and explains how data analysis is performed in the real world. Practical solutions are developed and represent an introduction to specific tasks that a business analyst completes on a daily basis that ultimately would help in analysing, communicating and validating recommendations to change the business and policies of an organisation.

 All concepts are introduced by providing the necessary theoretical background followed by real-life data analytics tasks that inevitably involve computer-based exercises that fully exemplify how the entire analysis is performed before the recommendations are disseminated to the end-user. 

The topics covered are related to standard quantitative methods and will include:

- Probability Distributions
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Regression using Dummy Variables
- Linear Probability Model, Logit and Probit Regression
- Penalised Regression Models
- Generalised Linear Model
- Generalised Additive Models
- Cluster Analysis
