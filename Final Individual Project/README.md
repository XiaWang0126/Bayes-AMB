# Final Individal Course Project

## Project Description

For this assignment you need to use data frame wine which contains information on prices and growing characteristics of 25 Bordeaux wines from 1952 to 1998. The data frame contains 7 columns and 47 rows. The columns are: year of production year, average price of the wines as a percentage of the 1961 price (price), mm of rain in the harvest month (h.rain), average temperature (C) over the summer preceding harvest (s.temp), mm of rain in the winter preceding harvest (w.rain), average temperature (C) at har- vest (h.temp), a rating of the wine quality (parker).

See https://www.wine-searcher.com/critics-27-robert+parker+the+wine+advocate for details on parker.

The aim of the analysis is to model the response variable price as a function of the variables described above.
Using these data, write a report addressing the following points:

(a) Justification of the chosen regression model specification.

(b) Using the final model, provide a summary (e.g., using tables and figures) of the empirical findings as well as interpretation of the estimated model parameters.

(c) Provide recommendations and limitations of your analysis.

(d) What did you learn from the analysis? What is the answer, if any, to the questions you set out to address? How can the analysis be improved?
